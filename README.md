## Hello, I'm Erick and I'm a junior at UCI with a major in Computer Science and minor in Statistics 🐣

With over three years of professional tutoring experience, I have developed a strong foundation in education. My passion for teaching is matched by my dedication to coding, 
where I am both formally trained and self-taught. Java is my primary programming language, creating personal project called Test Tutor. Utalizing JavaFX and SQLite, 
I created a self study software that makes preparing for Calclus exams a more streamlined process. I am also building my skills in C and Python, as I continue to study.
