## Hello, I'm Erick and I'm a junior at UCI with a major in Computer Science and minor in Statistics üê£

With over three years of professional tutoring experience, I have developed a strong foundation in education. My passion for teaching is matched by my dedication to coding, 
where I am both formally trained and self-taught. Java is my primary programming language, creeating personal project called 
TestTutor. Utalizing JavaFX and SQLite, I created a self study software that makes preparing for Calclus exams a more streamlined process.
I am also building my skills in C and Python, as I continue to study.
